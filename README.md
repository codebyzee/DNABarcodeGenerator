This project is a Java-based DNA Barcode Generator that produces random DNA barcode sequences with specific validation criteria. The application generates DNA barcodes of specified lengths and quantities, ensuring that the barcodes meet certain biological constraints.

Features
Generate Random DNA Barcodes: Generates random DNA sequences of a specified length.
Restriction Check: Ensures that the generated barcode does not match any sequences in a predefined restricted list.
GC Content Validation: Validates that the GC content of the barcode is between 40% and 60%.
Redundancy Check: Ensures that the barcode does not contain three consecutive identical nucleotides.
